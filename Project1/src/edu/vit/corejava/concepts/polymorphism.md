## Types of polymorphism
1. compile-time polymorphism.
2. run-time polymorphism.
## Compile-time polymorphism
* It is also known as static polymorphism.
* This type of polymorphism is achieved by function and operator overloading.
>But java doesn't support operator overloading
## Run-time polymorphism
* It is also known as Dynamic method dispatch.
* It is a process in which a function call to the overridden method is resolved at Runtime.
* This type of polymorphism is achieved by Method Overriding.
* Method overriding, on the other hand, occurs when a derived class has a definition for one of the member functions of the base class. That base function is said to be overridden.
